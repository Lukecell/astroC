# astroC
Doing astronomy calculations in C. I tried experimenting with this stuff in Python, but it was too slow and I wanted some practice with C anyways

Note: None of the stuff in vec.c or vec.h is my own, I copied it from c-vector at https://github.com/Mashpoe/c-vector . Just including the source files so its easier to build, dunno the best practices for including libraries
